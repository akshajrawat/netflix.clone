# 🎬 Netflix Clone (HTML + CSS)

This is a **Netflix Landing Page Clone** built using **HTML** and **CSS** only. It's my **first web development project**, and I created it to learn the basics of web design, layout techniques, and responsive styling.

I also used this project to practice basic **Git and GitHub commands** like `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
